This is my project which tries to emulate the bash terminal. However, this is without commands that don't require bin i.e cd. 
I used execvp to execute commands in the bin file.


Bugs:
======

1. Unable to exit from program when there's a space before exit.
2. Unable to do comments
3. Unable to run with connectors.
4. Unable to use the command "finger"
5. Unable to use quotes in command
6. Unable to echo after certain spaces
